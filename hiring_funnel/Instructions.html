<h2>Study Instructions (Continued)</h2>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <p>For each score, the higher numbers indicate better evaluations. You can think of each score as a noisy signal of the candidate's true underlying quality. Sometimes a candidate will perform a bit better or worse than their true ability in a particular stage (for example, they might have a great or bad day in one interview), so no single score is perfectly accurate on its own. Historically, it is known that each evaluation scores have error that is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation {{ sigma_resume }}.</p>

  <p><strong>Your Decision Process:</strong> In each round, you will see all 10 candidates and go through three gates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gate 1 (Resume):</strong> Select exactly 5 candidates to advance based on their Resume scores.</li>
    <li><strong>Gate 2 (Zoom):</strong> From the 5 remaining candidates, select exactly 3 to advance based on their Zoom interview scores.</li>
    <li><strong>Gate 3 (In-Person):</strong> From the 3 remaining candidates, hire 1 based on their In-Person interview scores.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
{% else %}
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <p><strong>Your Decision Process:</strong> In each round, you will see all 10 candidates with scores across all three stages (Resume, Zoom, and In-Person) displayed simultaneously. You will directly select one candidate to hire based on all available information.</p>
</div>
{% endif %}

<p><strong>Parameter Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>True Quality: Mean = 50, Std Dev = 15</li>
  <li>Resume Score Noise: Std Dev = 15</li>
  <li>Zoom Score Noise: Std Dev = 15</li>
  <li>In-Person Score Noise: Std Dev = 15</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus Payment:</strong> Your final bonus will be calculated based on ONE randomly selected main round. For that round, your bonus will be: $4.00 + 0.05 × (true quality of hired candidate), capped at $10.00.</p>
