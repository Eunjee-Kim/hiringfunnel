  <h3>Scenario: Hiring for a Junior Analyst Position with a Funnel</h3>
  <p>Imagine you are a member of the hiring committee at a mid-sized company that is looking to hire a new Junior Analyst. The company cares a lot about the true underlying quality of the person they hire—things like analytical skills, communication, reliability, and general problem-solving ability.</p>
  <p>Historically, it is known that for candidates who apply for this job, the true quality is normally distributed with mean {{ mu }} and standard deviation {{ sigma }}.</p>
